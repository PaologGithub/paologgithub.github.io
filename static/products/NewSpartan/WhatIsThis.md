# What is this?
Yeah, there is already a NewSpartan page, so why is there two pages.

## This is totally normal
Because the old paologgithub.github.io website pages was under the /products URL, 
NewSpartan Installer and error page was at [/products](https://paologgithub.github.io/products/NewSpartan). So, to don't break all, there is this page, which serve the error page and the NewSpartan installer.
